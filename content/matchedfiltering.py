    We're doing a little interactive project to give you a better feel for how LIGO data analysis actually works.  In particular, we'll be doing **matched filtering** of some data, including the data from the historic first detection of gravitational waves, GW150914.

    You can kind of think of LIGO as a really sensitive microphone, and the data that comes out is like a sound recording.  (Except, of course, that sound requires air, while gravitational waves travel through spacetime itself.)  In fact, if you go to the LIGO control room, they'll often play the data over speakers, because this is a really useful way of thinking about the data.  It even happens to be in the right range for human hearing.  So we'll be listening to LIGO data and gravitational waveforms.

    One of the first things you'll discover about the data is that it's full of noise, so we'll need to deal with that noise to pull out our signal.  We'll start off with the simplest way to deal with noise, involving the Fourier transform, and find that it actually works well enough to let us hear the GW150914 signal.  But if we want to do real science, we'll need to do better, so we'll introduce some real LIGO data analysis, including matched filters.

    This is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (formerly known as an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)).  It's connected to an actual python session, but it runs through a web browser, so we can format things nicely and give some explanations, and so you don't have to copy-and-paste all the instructions into a normal python session.  Plus, you can edit the code and explore the data interactively.  It's meant to look and work kind of like Mathematica, if you've ever used that before.  (And if you don't care for python, Jupyter also handles [Julia](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/jdj.mit.edu/~stevenj/IJulia%20Preview.ipynb), [R](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel), [IDL](https://github.com/lstagner/idl_kernel), and numerous other languages.)

    We notice a few important features in the time domain:

      - The amplitude is shut off entirely at the beginning, but quickly turns on.  This is done for technical reasons (to get rid of the so-called Gibbs phenomenon -- but don't worry about it).  Of course, a real gravitational-wave signal would extend fairly regularly very far back in time.
      - The amplitude is slowly growing at first, but accelerates to a peak, and then basically shuts off again.  This part is real.  That's the merger and ringdown, where the black holes give off the strongest gravitational waves just as they fall into each other, which happens very suddenly.
      - The frequency is slowly increasing at first, but accelerates up to the merger.  This is another effect of the inspiral; as energy is given off in gravitational waves, the black holes spiral inwards toward each other and go faster and faster.

    These translate to some interesting features in the frequency domain:

      - The amplitude at low frequencies is shut off.  This is for the same reason as the time-domain signal: we just don't have a long enough signal to reach those low frequencies.  A real signal would keep going in a straight line off to the upper left.
      - Whereas the amplitude of the time-domain waveform *increases* as the frequency increases, the amplitude of the Fourier transform *decreases* as the frequency increases.
      - Around $250\, \mathrm{Hz}$, the amplitude drops off very suddenly.  This dropoff represents the merger.

    ## Questions
      * Can you hear any of the features that you see in the plots?
      * Why does the amplitude of the Fourier transform *decrease* as the frequency increases?
      * Why does it sound so quiet at the beginning and loud at the highest frequency?

    LIGO has a lot of noise.  This is entirely expected when dealing with such a sensitive apparatus, but it does swamp the signal.  The key to LIGO's success is that the noise is pretty steady (or technically, "stationary"), and the noise is largest at frequencies that aren't the most interesting.  We can recover the interesting part of the signal by decreasing the size of the noise.  We will do this using a "graphic equalizer".

    A graphic equalizer divides the signal into frequency bands, allows you to adjust the volume in each band, and then combines the signal back into a time-domain signal.  You may have seen graphic equalizers in old or high-end stereos:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chengj7/MatchedFiltering/refs/heads/binder/content/70sEqualizer.jpg" width=640 title="Apparently, this and an eight-track of the Eagles' greatest hits were considered cool in the '70s..."
     alt="Creative Commons license via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez6agxLfEeM">

    Nowadays, you might see "bass" and "treble" (and maybe even "mid") controls, which do the same thing, but break the signal down into fewer frequency bands.

    We're going to do the same thing, but without the old-timey hardware.  The cell below sets up a graphic equalizer, then produces the "equalized" data for you to look at and listen to.  Mess around with the settings, then press "Recalculate" to see how well you can pick out the signal we're looking for.

    Spend some time playing around with the equalizer to pull out the signal.  (Hint: the low and high frequencies are where most of the noise is, and where less of the signal is.)

    You can also add some notch filters to eliminate sharp spikes in the frequency-domain data, if you think they're more like noise than signal.  A notch filter is like another equalizer slider, except that you get to control where its frequency band begins and ends, and it sets everything in that band as low as it can go.

    The signal you're looking for peaks near the middle of the data (around $t=16.4\, \mathrm{sec}$).


    ## Questions
      * Can you adjust the filters so that you can see the peak amplitude in the time domain?  What does it look like when you zoom in?  Can you hear it?
      * If you leave the $45\,\mathrm{Hz}$ band in the data, you see (and hear) big slow oscillations in the time-domain amplitude that are *much* slower than $45\,\mathrm{Hz}$.  Can you explain where these come from, and why they oscillate like that?
      * How does the largest data point of your filtered data (in the time domain) compare to the largest point in the raw data?  Why is this?
      * With good settings, you should be able to see a large spike right in the middle of the data.  But there are other spikes, too.  How is the middle spike different from the others?

    There are several ways we could improve the crude filtering we did above with our "equalizer".  We'll try two improvements in this section, and more in the following sections.

    First, we could throw in more sliders to adjust for more precise equalization.  In fact, the only natural number of sliders is one for every frequency bin in the Fourier transform.  But there are already so many sliders for us to adjust that it gets tiring; we'd never be able to manually adjust them all.  Plus, we want something automatic that will work in every case.  Second, therefore, we can adjust the sliders automatically.  Roughly speaking, at frequencies with a lot of noise, we want to filter out a lot of the signal; at frequencies with little noise, we don't want to filter much.

    The first step is to measure the noise as a function of frequency.  We already know that the signal is very small during most of our data, so we could define the noise at a particular frequency to just be the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the data.  But noise is random, and we've only taken a small sample of this random process, so we'd like to average the spectrum.  It turns out that a good way to do this is to split the data into chunks, measure the noise in each chunk, and then average the results — or more precisely the root mean square (RMS).  There are some additional tricks to deal smooth out the splitting process, and make sure we use all the data without overcounting some, etc.  All these tricks are dealt with in what is called "Welch's method".

    If you zoom in, you can see that our estimated noise spectrum is substantially smoother than the raw data, as we hoped.  It also emphasizes spikes because we used the RMS instead of just the simple mean.

    So now that we've estimated the noise, we can use it to automatically "equalize" the raw data.  Remember that where the noise is large we want a lot of filtering, and where the noise is small we want little filtering.  So we just divide the raw data by the noise estimate:

    Unfortunately, this isn't nearly as good as what we could achieve manually using the graphic equalizer above.  If you zoom in, you might be able to convince yourself that the signal is there, and you should be able to hear a little blip at the right time.  But unless you knew it was there, you'd have a hard time convincing yourself.  Looking at the frequency-domain plot, we see why: There's still a lot of noise at the very high and low frequencies that are much smaller, but not gone.  Also, the spikes have not entirely gone away.  If you look back at our noise estimate around those spikes, you see that the estimate smears them out.  So evidently our way of estimating the noise is not good for very sharp features.

    We can solve each of these problems, however.  We'll solve the first by removing the high- and low-frequency components even more than the "equalization" did.  We'll solve the second by removing those lines with notch filters before "equalizing" the data.

    The first step is to create notch filters for the spikes we see in the input spectrum.  This time, we'll do a slightly better job using smooth notches, instead of the sharp square notches we used above.  Here we list each notch (beginning and ending frequencies) and something related to the depth of the notch.  This may not seem very automatic, but these spikes are fairly constant, so we can just list them once and use the same list forever.  In fact, that's what [LIGO does](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.082002).

    These are two pretty large signals.  They also match each other really nicely, and they arrived at different places on the earth close in time to each other.  Taken together, this already argues pretty strongly that these are gravitational waves.  In fact, the LIGO collaboration's analysis of their data suggest that — without any black holes — a coincidence like this would only happen no more than once in every 8400 years of data.  Considering that their analysis only covered 16 days of data, it's pretty unlikely to just be coincidence.  But that's a very crude way of looking at the data.

    We can do much better if we try to fit this data with an analytical waveform.  In fact, we can use an expected signal to find gravitational waves in our data even when they're completely swamped by the noise and we have no chance of seeing or hearing them.  More than just *detecting* the waves, we'll also be able to *measure* the systems that generated them if we try lots of different "expected" signals and see which one matches best.

    We've really improved the signal just by filtering out what we suspect to be noise.  But most signals LIGO will see will be much smaller than this one.  And we need some more quantitative assessment than "Yeah, that sounds right."  We need to compare the data to a model.

    If we have a model waveform from some numerical simulation, we can use that information to test if the model signal is present in the data.  The trick is to line the model up with where we think it is in the data, and then just multiply the model times the data at each point.  Places where the model is positive and the data is positive will stay positive; places where they are both negative will multiply to a positive.  So anywhere the model and the data are the same, we can expect to find a positive product.  Places where they are different will give us a negative product.

    If the product is more positive than negative for a lot of the time, we can say that our signal is probably present in the data.  If the signal isn't the same as the data, their product will just randomly wander back and forth between positive and negative.  So to make this more quantitative still, we can look at the average value of the product.  To make this all very simple, if our detector data is $d(t)$ and our simulated data is $s(t)$, we'll evaluate the correlation
    \begin{equation}
      c = \int_T\ d(t)\, s(t)\, dt.
    \end{equation}
    If this is a large positive number, we have good evidence that $s$ is present in $d$.

    First, though, we have to make sure that our model is lined up with the data and looks like it's found in the data.  We'll just plot the simulated signal right on top of the filtered detector data.

    This looks fishy because early on, the simulated signal is quite large, but the detector data is clearly much smaller.  We might conclude that the data does not actually contain this signal.  However, we've done nothing to the simulated waveform, whereas we've applied very strong filtering to the detector data.  In particular, the noise gets large at low frequencies, so we've reduced the amplitude of the data there.  But early on, our simulated signal has lots of power at low frequencies.

    LIGO searches for signals by evaluating the correlation for huge numbers of possible systems, using huge numbers of "simulated" waveforms.  This is a very computationally expensive problem.  But one thing that makes it even worse is that we don't know when a binary might be merging out in the universe, so we have to shift the simulated waveform around in time to find the best correlation.  On top of that, we don't know what orientation the binary might have, so we have to rotate the simulated waveform to find the best correlation.  If we had to rotate the simulated waveform for every possible rotation, offset the simulated waveform for every possible time offset, and then multiply the waveforms and integrate for each possibility, LIGO would never be able to work quickly enough to actually find a system.  But we can do better with some clever math tricks.

    To start with, assume that we have the right rotation and time offset.  We can find a different way of integrating the correlation in time.  The [convolution theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem) tells us that the product $g(t)\, h(t)$ is equal to the inverse Fourier transform of the convolution of the Fourier transforms:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      g(t)\, h(t)
      &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \tilde{g}(f')\, \tilde{h}(f-f')\, df'\right]\, e^{2\pi i f t}\, df, \\
      &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \tilde{g}(f')\, \tilde{h}^\ast(f'-f)\, df'\right]\, e^{2\pi i f t}\, df.
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    In the second line, we use the fact that our signals are real, so $\tilde{h}(f-f') = \tilde{h}^\ast(f'-f)$.  Now, if we integrate both sides over $t$, we can exchange the order of integrations and use a formula for the [Dirac $\delta$ function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) to eliminate the integrals over $t$ and $f$, so we're left with
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \tag{1}
      \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ g(t)\, h(t)\, dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \tilde{g}(f')\, \tilde{h}^\ast(f')\, df'.
    \end{equation}
    $$
    That is, we can evaluate our correlation in the time domain or the frequency domain, as we see fit.

    But now, let's think about the time offset — and ignore the unknown rotation for a moment.  Since we don't really know when any binary might be merging in the universe, we have to find the best correlation as we shift the simulated data by some $\delta t$.  It's not too hard to prove this fact about the Fourier transform: If $g(t) \mapsto \tilde{g}(f)$, then
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      g(t + \delta t) \mapsto \tilde{g}(f)\, e^{2\pi\, i\, f\, \delta t}.
    \end{equation}
    $$
    So we can generalize the equation above to read
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \tag{2}
      \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ g(t + \delta t)\, h(t)\, dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \tilde{g}(f')\, \tilde{h}^\ast(f')\, e^{2\pi\, i\, f\, \delta t}\, df'.
    \end{equation}
    $$
    The right-hand side is just the inverse Fourier transform of $\tilde{g}(f')\, \tilde{h}^\ast(f')$, but this is easy and fast to compute!  In this case, the inverse Fourier transform is a function of $\delta t$, so we can compute it, and then just pick the largest value, and we've automatically optimized the time offset.

    Now let's consider the rotation.  If you dig down into the theory of gravitational waves, you'll find that they're actually best described as complex numbers — or more specifically, a gravitational wave is a complex-valued transverse wave.  Our detectors just pick out one part of this complex field because it would cost about twice as much to pick out both parts.  If you were to rotate the detector, you would also rotate the phase of the underlying complex field, but the detector would still just pick out one part — say, the real part.  That is, the quantity $g$ above is actually the real part of some complex $G$, for which $G \mapsto e^{i\phi} G$.  So, we have
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      g = \Re\{G\} \mapsto \Re\{e^{i\phi} G\} = g\cos\phi - g'\sin\phi,
    \end{equation}
    $$
    where $g'=\Im\{G\}$.

    So far in this section, we've been assuming that both signals $g$ and $h$ are already "equalized" by the noise spectrum.  The squared noise spectrum is usually written $S_n(f)$.  Using this, we define the "match" between two not-yet-equalized signals to be
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      M(g, h)
      &= \max_{\delta t}{}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ g(t + \delta t)\, h(t)\, dt, \\
      &= \max_{\delta t}{}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\ \frac{\tilde{g}(f)\, \tilde{h}^\ast(f)} {S_n(f)}\, e^{2\pi\, i\, f\, \delta t}\, df.
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    The last form is just the inverse Fourier transform, and since the (inverse) FFT is such an efficient algorithm, it can be computed very quickly, and we just pick out the largest element of the result to get our answer.  This is the actual formula that LIGO uses to run its searches.

    Now, to see how this works, we can apply it to the GW150914 data from above.  We just take the Fourier-domain filtered detector data, multiply it by the Fourier-domain filtered simulated template signal (conjugated), and take the inverse FFT.  The maximum value will tell us how much to offset the detector data to match the simulated signal as well as possible.

    # 8. More detections!

    Since the first detection, there have been several other detections and "triggers".  A "trigger" is what LIGO calls an event that initially looks like a detection, but has not been evaluated in enough detail for them to be confident that it actually is an astrophysical phenomenon.

    You have been given some data of your own, containing data very similar to one of the four events that LIGO has identified so far.  Your job is to find out which one.  To make things a little easier on you, we first condense all of the fancy filtering and matching done above into a single function:
